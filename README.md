# Wired Server 2.5

Wired Server is BBS-oriented server for UNIX-based operating systems. It uses [libwired](https://github.com/nark/libwired) and provide an implementation of the Wired 2.0 protocol. This project is a fork of the original Wired Server developed by Axel Andersson at [Zanka Software](http://zankasoftware.com/).

### Requirements

This program is mainly tested on Debian/Ubuntu Linux distributions, FreeBSD and Mac OS X. The source code is under BSD license and is totally free for use with respect of its attributed license.

To install the Wired server, you need the following prerequisites:

* **OpenSSL**: [http://www.openssl.org/source/](http://www.openssl.org/source/)
* **libxml2**: [http://xmlsoft.org/](http://xmlsoft.org/)
* **zlib**: [http://zlib.net/](http://zlib.net/)
* **git**: [http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/)

These are usually distributed with operating systems.

#### Howto install on:

**Debian/Ubuntu**

	sudo apt-get install -y build-essential autoconf git libsqlite3-dev libxml2-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev

**CentOS 7**

    sudo yum -y install git libtool openssl-devel sqlite-devel.x86_64 libxml2-devel zlib-devel autoconf gcc make

**CentOS 8 / Fedora 28/29/30/31 (and probably even older versions of Fedora)**

    sudo yum -y install git libtool openssl-devel sqlite-devel libxml2-devel zlib-devel autoconf gcc make


### Getting started

Installing Wired Server from sources will be done using the Autotools standard (configure, make, make install).

##### 1. Get Wired Server sources via Terminal (git must be installed!):

	git clone https://github.com/nark/wired wired

Then move to the `wired` directory:

	cd wired/

Initialize and update submodules repositories:

	git submodule update --init --recursive --remote

	libwired/bootstrap

Then check that the `libwired` directory was not empty and `configure` file exists.

##### 3. Run the configuration script:

During the configuration, scripts will check that your environment fills the requirements described at the top of this document. You will be warned if any of the required component is missing on your operating system.

To start configuration, use the following command:

	./configure

Wired Server is designed to be installed into `/usr/local` by default. To change this, run:

	./configure --prefix=/path	

To change the default user the installation will write files as, run:

	./configure --with-user=USER

If you installed OpenSSL in a non-standard path, use the following command example as reference:

	env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include \
	     LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib ./configure

If you installed a recent version (=>1.1.0) OpenSSL configure will complain about SSL_library_init which is deprecared, use this:

	env CPPFLAGS="-DOPENSSL_API_COMPAT=0x10000000L"
	     
Use `./configure --help` in order to display more options.

##### 4. Compile source code:

On GNU-like unices, type:

	make

Or, on BSD-like unices, type: 

	gmake

##### 5. Install on your system:

On GNU-like unices, type:

	make install

Or, on BSD-like unices, type: 

	gmake install


This will require write permissions to `/usr/local/`, or whatever directory you set as the prefix above. Depending of your OS setup, you may require to use `sudo`.

##### 6. Running Wired Server

To start an installed Wired server, run:

	/usr/local/wired/wiredctl start

By default a user with the login "admin" and no password is created. Use Wired Client or Wire to connect to your newly installed Wired Server. 

### Running on Docker

Pull and run the container:

    docker run --name wired -d -p 4871:4871 -v /path/to/yours/files:/files wired2/wired:2.5

* the `-p` option maps the container port (`4871`) to whatever the port you want to use on your host machine. If you want `wired` to be available on another you can use: `10000:4871` and Docker will translate it.
* the `-v` option maps items of the container file system with your local file system. You can change the first value of the pair to adjust to your server files configuration. Wired Server will look into the `/files` path of the container to index and server your files. 

If you want Docker to start the container automatically for you, add the `--restart always` argument as follow:

    docker run --name wired --restart always -d -p 4871:4871 -v /path/to/yours/files:/files wired2/wired:2.5

Start/stop the container:

    docker stop wired
    docker start wired
    
Remove the container:

    docker rm wired
    
It could be useful to backup and restore container files such as `database.sqlite3` or `wired.conf`. You can do that do using the `docker cp` command.
    
From container to host:
    
    docker cp wired:/user/local/wired/database.sqlite3 /path/to/your/database.sqlite3

From host to container:

    docker cp /path/to/your/database.sqlite3 wired:/user/local/wired/database.sqlite3
    
Build the image locally:

    cd wired/
    docker build --tag wired:2.5 .
    
Tag the image:
    
    docker tag <image_id> wired2/wired:2.5
    
Push to Docker Hub:
    
    docker push wired2/wired:2.5

### Troubleshootings

This implementation of the Wired 2.0 protocol is not compliant with the version of the protocol distributed by Zanka Software, for several deep technical reasons.
