# Wired Server 2.5

Wired Server is BBS-oriented server for UNIX-based operating systems. It uses [libwired](https://github.com/nark/libwired) and provide an implementation of the Wired 2.0 protocol. This project is a fork of the original Wired Server developed by Axel Andersson at [Zanka Software](http://zankasoftware.com/).

### Requirements

This program is mainly tested on Debian/Ubuntu Linux distributions, FreeBSD and Mac OS X. The source code is under BSD license and is totally free for use with respect of its attributed license.

To install the Wired server, you need the following prerequisites:

* **OpenSSL**: [http://www.openssl.org/source/](http://www.openssl.org/source/)
* **libxml2**: [http://xmlsoft.org/](http://xmlsoft.org/)
* **zlib**: [http://zlib.net/](http://zlib.net/)
* **git**: [http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/)

These are usually distributed with operating systems.

#### Howto install on:

**Debian/Ubuntu**

	sudo apt-get install -y build-essential autoconf screen git libsqlite3-dev libxml2-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev autotools-dev automake

**Archlinux**

	sudo pacman -Sy base-devel autoconf screen git sqlite3 libxml2 zlib

**CentOS 7**

	sudo yum -y install screen git libtool openssl-devel sqlite-devel.x86_64 libxml2-devel zlib-devel autoconf gcc make

**CentOS 8 / Fedora 28/29/30/31 (and probably even older versions of Fedora)**

	sudo yum -y install screen git libtool openssl-devel sqlite-devel libxml2-devel zlib-devel autoconf gcc make

**openSUSE Leap 42.3 (and probably other Versions)**

	sudo zypper install -t pattern devel_basis 
	sudo zypper install screen git sqlite3-devel libxml2-devel libz1 openssl-devel

### Getting started

Installing Wired Server from sources will be done using the Autotools standard (configure, make, make install).

##### 1. Get Wired Server sources via Terminal (git must be installed!):

	git clone https://github.com/ProfDrLuigi/wired wired

Then move to the `wired` directory:

	cd wired/

Initialize and update submodules repositories:

	git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
	libwired/bootstrap

LetÂ´s do some minor fixes:

	find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/\-O2/\-O2\ \-fno\-stack\-protector/gI' {} \;
	sed -i 's/mktemp/mkstemp/g' libwired/libwired/file/wi-fs.c


Then check that the `libwired` directory was not empty and `configure` file exists.

##### 3. Run the configuration script:

During the configuration, scripts will check that your environment fills the requirements described at the top of this document. You will be warned if any of the required component is missing on your operating system.

To start configuration, use the following command:

	./configure

Wired Server is designed to be installed into `/usr/local` by default. To change this, run:

	./configure --prefix=/path	

To change the default user the installation will write files as, run:

	./configure --with-user=USER

If you installed OpenSSL in a non-standard path, use the following command example as reference:

	env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include \
	     LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib ./configure

Use `./configure --help` in order to display more options.



##### 4. Compile source code:

On GNU-like unices, type:

	make

Or, on BSD-like unices, type: 

	gmake

##### 5. Install on your system:

On GNU-like unices, type:

	make install

Or, on BSD-like unices, type: 

	gmake install


This will require write permissions to `/usr/local/`, or whatever directory you set as the prefix above. Depending of your OS setup, you may require to use `sudo`.

##### 6. Running Wired Server

By default a user with the login "admin" and no password is created. Use Wired Client or Wire to connect to your newly installed Wired Server. 

Wired is compiled as foreground Task in Debug mode. Thats why you nee to run it in a screen-Session.
If you run it in Daemon Mode your CPU will going crazy after some time (100% usage).

To start an installed Wired server, run:

	screen -Sdm wired /usr/local/wired/wiredctl start

To enter the running screen session (wiredctl) simply type:
	
	screen -rS wired
	
To leave the session (not closing!) type

	ctrl + a and than d

### Troubleshootings

This implementation of the Wired 2.0/2.5 protocol is not compliant with the version of the protocol distributed by Zanka Software, for several deep technical reasons.
